# Week 3 – Reinforcement Learning

## Goal  
The goal of this learning module is to introduce **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** as a framework for sequential decision-making under uncertainty. Learners will understand how agents learn through interaction with an environment, how long-term rewards differ from immediate optimization, and how decision-making problems are modeled using Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).

This week focuses on building intuition first, followed by progressively introducing core RL algorithms such as **Q-learning**, **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**, and **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**. By the end of the module, learners will be able to reason about when different RL approaches are appropriate, understand their limitations, and be prepared to design and train agents for game-based environments.

## What You Will Learn
By the end of the week, you will understand the reinforcement learning framework, including agent–environment interaction, reward-driven learning, and long-term return optimization. You will learn how to model decision-making problems as Markov Decision Processes, define policies and value functions, and understand the role of the Markov assumption.

You will study value-based methods such as Q-learning, understand why tabular methods fail to scale, and see how Deep Q-Networks use neural networks to handle large state spaces. You will also gain intuition for policy-based methods and understand why PPO is widely used for continuous control and complex environments. This module emphasizes conceptual clarity and algorithmic motivation rather than implementation details.

## Recommended Resources

- **Primary Introduction to Reinforcement Learning**  
  https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZbbT5o_s2xoWNVdDudn51XM8lOuZ_Njv  
  This playlist serves as the primary introduction to reinforcement learning. It is short, easy to follow, and focuses on motivation, intuition, and the minimum necessary mathematics. Watching this playlist is sufficient to understand the core ideas behind RL and the progression from value-based to policy-based methods.

- **DeepMind Reinforcement Learning Lectures (Contextual)**  
  DeepMind RL Course — Lectures 8, 9, and 10  
  These lectures provide additional conceptual depth and broader context, including modern perspectives on value functions, policies, and learning from interaction. They are recommended for learners who want a deeper understanding beyond the basics.

- **Provided Notebooks (Conceptual Foundations)**  
  The following Jupyter notebooks are provided to build intuition before introducing learning-based algorithms:
  - MDP Modelling: Formalizing environments, states, actions, rewards, and transitions  
  - Value Iteration and Policy Iteration: Planning with known dynamics  
  - Action-Value Methods: Understanding value functions and optimality  

  These notebooks focus on understanding problem formulation and reasoning about optimal behavior, not on training deep models.

- **Deep-Dive References (Optional)**  
  These resources are not required for completion but are recommended for learners who wish to explore theoretical depth, formalism, or research-level material:
  - https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs234/modules.html  
    Comprehensive lecture notes covering the mathematical foundations of reinforcement learning.
  - https://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse-fa18/  
    Advanced deep reinforcement learning course material, including policy gradients and actor–critic methods.

## Assignment
This week prepares you for a game-based reinforcement learning assignment, where you will design agents to interact with environments rather than solve static prediction tasks. The assignment will focus on:
- Formulating environments as Markov Decision Processes
- Designing states, actions, and rewards
- Choosing appropriate RL algorithms
- Analyzing learning behavior and failure modes

Ensure that the code is well commented.
 and if you ever feel stuck, feel free to reach out to both of us.
 Submit your work by 3rd January via webmail to 24B3935@iitb.ac.in and 24b3962@iitb.ac.in
