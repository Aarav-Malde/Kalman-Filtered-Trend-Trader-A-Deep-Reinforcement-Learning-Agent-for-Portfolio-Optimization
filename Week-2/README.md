For a deeper understanding of **Kalman filtering in trading**, we recommend the following resources:
• **Books on Kalman Filtering**:

- *Kalman Filtering: Theory and Practice Using MATLAB by Mohinder S. Grewal and Angus P. Andrews* (very high level, can skip)
    - Chapter 1: Introduction to Kalman Filtering (pages 1–22)
    - Chapter 3: One-Dimensional Kalman Filter (pages 45–69)
    - Chapter 4: Multi-Dimensional Kalman Filter (pages 71–100)
- *Bayesian Filtering and Smoothing by Simo Särkkä* (explores the Control Theory aspects of Kalman Filters as well)
    - Chapter 2: Kalman Filter for Linear Systems (pages 9–24)
    - Chapter 4: Introduction to the Extended Kalman Filter (pages 57–75)
- *An Introduction to the Kalman Filter by Greg Welch and Gary Bishop*
    - Section 2: Kalman Filter Equations (pages 2–10)
    - Section 3: Implementation of a Simple Kalman Filter (pages 11–18)

• **Kalman Filtering in Python**: For a practical, hands-on guide to implementing Kalman filters in Python, refer to the following resource:

-[Kalman and Bayesian Filters in Python - 1D Kalman Filter](https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python/blob/master/04-One-Dimensional-Kalman-Filters.ipynb)

• **Additional Resource**:

-[Kalman Filter for Linear Regression](https://letianzj.github.io/kalman-filter-linear-regression.html): A great resource for understanding how Kalman filtering can be applied to linear regression, helping you deepen your understanding of Kalman filtering in the context of pairs trading.

-[How a Kalman Filter Works in Pictures](https://www.bzarg.com/p/how-a-kalman-filter-works-in-pictures/): A visual guide to understanding how Kalman filters operate.
